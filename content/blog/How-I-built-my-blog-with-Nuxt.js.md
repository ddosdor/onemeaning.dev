I've always believed that the best way to learn and deepen your knowledge is to pass it on. So, early in my career as a developer, I decided to create my own personal blog where I could share what I enjoy, experiment with new tools (everything was new to me back then), and keep notes on what I had already learned.

At the time, I thought Wordpress would be the best choice for a blog. Since I had no experience with the tool at the time, I didn't realize how much time, money, and problems it would cost me. Nevertheless, the site existed for a while.
