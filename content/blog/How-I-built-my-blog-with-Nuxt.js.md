I've always believed that the best way to learn and deepen your knowledge is to pass it on. So, early in my development career, I decided to start my own blog where I could share what I enjoyed, experiment with new tools (everything was new to me then), and keep notes on what I had already learned.

At the time, I thought Wordpress would be the best choice for a blog. Since I had no experience with the tool at the time, I didn't realize how much time, money, and hassle it would cost me. Nevertheless, the site existed for a while.

Eventually, I decided to go back to blogging because after working as a developer for a few years, I noticed that I love sharing knowledge. This time, learned from experience, I decided to take a few things into consideration before starting the blog. 

- **Fun and experience** - I wanted to use tools that I personally enjoy working with, because I believe that this project should be fun
- **Learning new things** - I wanted to experiment with new things and use this project to gain new experience 
- **Saving time and money** - I wanted to publish new posts or other things quickly, without having to use complicated tools, and also save on maintenance costs
